# RTIConnectorAndGazebo
Repository for reference when working with RTI Connext DDS and Gazebo for robot simulations, and you want to use RTI Connector to interact with them.


This repository includes some aplications to interact with the DDS plugins integrated in the Gazebo simulator. These plugins enable DDS-based robotic systems to leverage Gazebo's simulation capabilities, such as 3D simulation and computer vision.

Install Gazebo and Gazebo DDS Plugins, you can get the intructions from here:
